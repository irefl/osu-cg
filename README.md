osu!cg is a graphics overlay system run in NodeCG similar to those commonly used in TF2 production. NodeCG allows powerful stream graphics in a browser, and thusly especially suits setups where there is often a sole producer.

Being web based allows individual tournaments to easily customize the package to their liking while keeping core functionality. In the long run it would likely replace most of the client background on the stream end.

General goals for "v1":


* Automated pick/ban graphic
* Dynamic chat with hallowatcher's chat library thing
* Easily customizable score overlay
